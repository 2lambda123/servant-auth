  - description: 'acceptLogin' and 'makeCsrfCookie' functions
    notes: >
        'makeCsrfCookie' for CSRF cookies.
        Renamed 'makeCookie' to 'makeSessionCookie' to avoid confusion
        ('makeCookie' is now an alias for 'makeSessionCookie' and is marked as
        deprecated).
        'acceptLogin' sets both the token and CSRF cookies.
